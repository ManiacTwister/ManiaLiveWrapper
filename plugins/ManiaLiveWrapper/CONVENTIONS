 * Namespace === Directory structure under libraries/
 * ONE CLASS PER FILE !
 * Exception: for the exceptions, you can put an exception 
   definition at the end of a file if the file is the only 
   one that uses that exception
 * Filename: ClassName.class.php
 * Use long explicit names. Namespaces are made for that.
 * Everything should be in at least one namespace
 * Use classes as much as possible
 * Every Event class must end with Event (....\SomeEvent or ...\Some\Event)
 * Every Listener class must end with Listener (...\SomeListener or ...\Some\Listener)
 * We decided to use only player logins to identify them, though there's also functions for Ids
